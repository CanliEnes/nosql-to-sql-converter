# NoSQL to SQL Converter Engine 🔄

**Author:** Enes CANLI  

## 📖 Overview
The **NoSQL to SQL Converter Engine** is an autonomous, schema-less data transformation tool developed in Python. It is designed to take deeply nested, unstructured NoSQL data (JSON format) and dynamically convert it into highly structured, normalized Relational Database (SQL/SQLite) tables. 

This tool eliminates the need for hardcoded schemas by recursively analyzing the incoming data, flattening nested objects, and extracting arrays into their own related sub-tables via Primary/Foreign Key relations to meet **1NF, 2NF, and 3NF** database normalization rules.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic JSON Parsing:** Automatically traverses and flattens complex, nested JSON objects regardless of depth.
* **Autonomous Normalization:** 
  * Detects lists/arrays and isolates them into child tables (1NF).
  * Auto-generates unique Auto-Increment Primary Keys for every new table (2NF).
  * Automatically maps hierarchical relationships using Foreign Keys (3NF).
* **Interactive ER Diagram Visualizer:** Includes a Tkinter-based GUI that visually maps out the created SQL tables and their Foreign Key connections in real-time.
* **Statistical Data View:** Provides graphical bar charts showing the row counts/data distributions across all dynamically generated tables.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Database:** SQLite (In-Memory Database Engine)
* **GUI & Visualization:** Tkinter, Canvas

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the application via terminal:
```bash
python Main.py
```
4. Click the **"JSON Yükle"** button to select a JSON file from the `test_data` folder.
5. Click **"Dönüştür"** to watch the engine map the data into relational tables and draw the ER diagram instantly!

## 📂 Project Structure
* `Main.py` : The main Tkinter application entry point.
* `modules/parser.py` : Handles recursive JSON flattening algorithms.
* `modules/converter.py` : Applies normalization rules and orchestrates the transformation.
* `modules/db_engine.py` : Executes raw SQL queries (CREATE TABLE, INSERT) to SQLite.
* `modules/visualizer.py` : Renders the interactive Entity-Relationship (ER) graph and charts.
* `test_data/` : Contains sample complex JSON structures used for testing the engine.
